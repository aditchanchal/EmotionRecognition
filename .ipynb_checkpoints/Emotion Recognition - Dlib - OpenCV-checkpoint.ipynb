    "\n",
    "   How you extract features from your source data is actually where a lot of research is, it’s not just about creating better classifying algorithms but also about finding better ways to collect and describe data. The same classifying algorithm might function tremendously well or not at all depending on how well the information we feed it is able to discriminate between different objects or object states. If, for example, we would extract eye colour and number of freckles on each face, feed it to the classifier, and then expect it to be able to predict what emotion is expressed, we would not get far. However, the facial landmarks from the same image material describe the position of all the “moving parts” of the depicted face, the things you use to express an emotion. This is certainly useful information!\n",

You might also continue and try to derive other measures from this that will tell the classifier more about what is happening on the face. Whether this is necessary or not depends. For now let’s assume it is necessary, and look at ways to extract more information from what we have. Feature generation is always a good thing to try, if only because it brings you closer to the data and might give you ideas or alternative views at it because you’re getting your hands dirty. Later on we’ll see if it was really necessary at a classification level."

Imagine one face with its eyebrows up high and mouth open, the person could be surprised. Now imagine an angry face with eyebrows down and mouth closed. If we normalise the landmark points on both faces from 0-1 and put them next to each other we might see two very similar faces. Because both distinguishing features lie at the edges of the face, normalising will push both back into a very similar shape. The faces will end up looking very similar. Take a moment to appreciate what we have done; we have thrown away most of the variation that in the first place would have allowed us to tell the two emotions from each other! Probably this will not work. Of course some variation remains from the open mouth, but it would be better not to throw so much away."

    "But, you may ask, why don’t we take for example the tip of the nose as the central point? This would work as well, but would also throw extra variance in the mix due to short, long, high- or low-tipped noses. The “centre point method” also introduces extra variance; the centre of gravity shifts when the head turns away from the camera, but I think this is less than when using the nose-tip method because most faces more or less face the camera in our sets. There are techniques to estimate head pose and then correct for it, but that is beyond this article."

This rotates the entire vector array so that tilted faces become similar to non-tilted faces with the same expression."

    "| Classifier | Full Dataset Acc | Reduced Dataset Acc         \n",

    "Therefore, we can note that all classifiers were better when using the reduced dataset because the categories are more balanced.\n",
    "Also, we can note that the Fisher Classifier had a similar or better accuracy than others classifiers. I am not sure why my results are different from the [original tutorial](http://www.paulvangent.com/2016/08/05/emotion-recognition-using-facial-landmarks/), but I can suppose that the Fisher Classifier that I have used is different from him: I have used the \"cv2.face.FisherFaceRecognizer_create()\" while the original tutorial has used \"cv2.createFisherFaceRecognizer()\". Besides that, the environment in general (python, dlib, opencv) can have different versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem using this tutorial was in the inital setup. I could not managed to follow the steps suggested by the author,  so I tried to setup my environment by myself:  \n",
    "Dowload OpenCV from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv) ou try \"pip install opencv-python\"  \n",
    "Install Dlib through conda: \"conda install -c conda-forge dlib=19.4\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I am sure that I have learned new things about how to detect faces, landmarks and how to use them in a classifier. Dlib is a useful library and makes the work to be easy!"
